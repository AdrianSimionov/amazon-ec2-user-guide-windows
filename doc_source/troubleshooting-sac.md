# Use SAC to troubleshoot your Windows instance<a name="troubleshooting-sac"></a>

The Special Admin Console \(SAC\) capability of Windows provides a way to troubleshoot a Windows instance\. By connecting to the instance's serial console and using SAC, you can interrupt the boot process and boot Windows in safe mode\.

## Limitations<a name="sac-limitations"></a>

If you enable SAC on an instance, the EC2 services that rely on password retrieval will not work from the Amazon EC2 console\. For example, EC2Launch, EC2Launch v2, and EC2Config will not be able to retrieve the Administrator password through the Amazon EC2 console\.

## Prerequisites<a name="sac-prerequisites"></a>

**To use SAC for troubleshooting a Windows instance, you must first complete the following prerequisites:**

1. Grant access to the serial console\. For more information, see [Configure access to the EC2 Serial Console](configure-access-to-serial-console.md)\.

1. Enable SAC and the boot menu\. For more information, see [Enable SAC and the boot menu](#configure-sac-bootmenu)\.

1. Connect to the serial console\. For more information, see [Connect to the EC2 Serial Console](connect-to-serial-console.md)\.

### Enable SAC and the boot menu<a name="configure-sac-bootmenu"></a>

Use one of the following methods to enable SAC and the boot menu on an instance\.

## Use the boot menu<a name="use-boot-menu"></a>

If the instance has the boot menu enabled and is restarted after connecting via SSH, you should see the boot menu, as follows\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/images/win-boot-1.png)

**Boot menu commands**

ENTER  
Starts the selected entry of the operating system\.

TAB  
Switches to the Tools menu\.

ESC  
Cancels and restarts the instance\.

ESC followed by 8  
Equivalent to pressing **F8**\. Shows advanced options for the selected item\.

ESC key \+ left arrow  
Goes back to the initial boot menu\.  
The ESC key alone does not take you back to the main menu because Windows is waiting to see if an escape sequence is in progress\.
