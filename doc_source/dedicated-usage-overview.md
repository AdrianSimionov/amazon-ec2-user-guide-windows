# Work with Dedicated Instances<a name="dedicated-usage-overview"></a>

You can create a VPC with an instance tenancy of `dedicated` to ensure that all instances launched into the VPC are Dedicated Instances\. Alternatively, you can specify the tenancy of the instance during launch\.

## Create a VPC with a dedicated instance tenancy<a name="creatingdedicatedvpc"></a>

When you create a VPC, you have the option of specifying its instance tenancy\. If you launch an instance into a VPC that has an instance tenancy of `dedicated`, your instance is automatically a Dedicated Instance, regardless of the tenancy of the instance\.

For more information on creating a VPC and choosing the tenancy options, see [Create a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-vpcs.html#Create-VPC) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

## Launch Dedicated Instances into a VPC<a name="dedicatedinstancesintovpc"></a>

You can launch a Dedicated Instance using the Amazon EC2 launch instance wizard\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**, **Launch instance**\.

1. In the **Application and OS Images** section, select an AMI from the list\.

1. In the **Instance type** section, select the instance type to launch\.
**Note**  
Ensure that you choose an instance type that's supported as a Dedicated Instance\. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/dedicated-instances/)\.

1. In the **Key pair** section, select the key pair to associate with the instance\.

1. In the **Advanced details** section, for **Tenancy**, select **Dedicated**\.

## Change the tenancy of an instance<a name="dedicated-change-tenancy"></a>

You can change the tenancy of a stopped instance only from `dedicated` to `host`, or from `host` to `dedicated` after launch\. The changes that you make take effect the next time the instance starts\.

**Note**  
You can't change the tenancy of an instance from `default` to `dedicated` or `host` after launch\. And you can't change the tenancy of an instance from `dedicated` or `host` to `default` after launch\.
For T3 instances, you can't change the tenancy from `dedicated` to `host`, or from `host` to `dedicated`\. Attempting to make one of these unsupported tenancy changes results in the `InvalidTenancy` error code\.

## Change the tenancy of a VPC<a name="change-tenancy-vpc"></a>

You can change the instance tenancy of a VPC from `dedicated` to `default` after you create it\. Modifying the instance tenancy of the VPC does not affect the tenancy of any existing instances in the VPC\. The next time you launch an instance in the VPC, it has a tenancy of `default`, unless you specify otherwise during launch\.

**Note**  
You cannot change the instance tenancy of a VPC from `default` to `dedicated` after it is created\.

You can modify the instance tenancy of a VPC using the AWS CLI, an AWS SDK, or the Amazon EC2 API only\.

------
#### [ Command line ]

**To modify the instance tenancy attribute of a VPC using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [modify\-vpc\-tenancy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-vpc-tenancy.html) command and specify the ID of the VPC and instance tenancy value\. The only supported value is `default`\.

```
aws ec2 modify-vpc-tenancy --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d --instance-tenancy default
```
