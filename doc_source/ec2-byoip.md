# Bring your own IP addresses \(BYOIP\) in Amazon EC2<a name="ec2-byoip"></a>

You can bring part or all of your publicly routable IPv4 or IPv6 address range from your on\-premises network to your AWS account\. You continue to own the address range, but AWS advertises it on the internet by default\. After you bring the address range to AWS, it appears in your AWS account as an address pool\.

BYOIP is not available in all Regions and for all resources\. For a list of supported Regions and resources, see the [FAQ for Bring Your Own IP](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#Bring_Your_Own_IP)\.

**Note**  
The following steps describe how to bring your own IP address range for use in Amazon EC2 only\. For steps to bring your own IP address range for use in AWS Global Accelerator, see [Bring your own IP addresses \(BYOIP\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/using-byoip.html) in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide*\.

**Topics**

+ [Configure your BYOIP address range](#prepare-for-byoip)
+ [Work with your address range](#byoip-working-with)
+ [Learn more](#byoip-learn-more)

## Requirements and quotas<a name="byoip-requirements"></a>
+ The address range must be registered with your regional internet registry \(RIR\), such as the American Registry for Internet Numbers \(ARIN\), Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre \(RIPE\), or Asia\-Pacific Network Information Centre \(APNIC\)\. It must be registered to a business or institutional entity and cannot be registered to an individual person\.
+ The most specific IPv4 address range that you can bring is /24\.
+ The most specific IPv6 address range that you can bring is /48 for CIDRs that are publicly advertised, and /56 for CIDRs that are [not publicly advertised](#byoip-provision-non-public)\.
+ You can bring each address range to one Region at a time\.
+ You can bring a total of five IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges per Region to your AWS account\.
+ You cannot share your IP address range with other accounts using AWS RAM unless you use Amazon VPC IP Address Manager \(IPAM\) and integrate IPAM with AWS Organizations\. For more information, see [Integrate IPAM with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/enable-integ-ipam.html) in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*\.
+ The addresses in the IP address range must have a clean history\. We might investigate the reputation of the IP address range and reserve the right to reject an IP address range if it contains an IP address that has a poor reputation or is associated with malicious behavior\.

## Configure your BYOIP address range<a name="prepare-for-byoip"></a>

The process to configure BYOIP has these phases:
+ **Preparation**

  For authentication purposes, create an RSA key pair and use it to generate a self\-signed X\.509 certificate\.
+ **RIR configuration** 

  Register with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure \(RPKI\) of your RIR, and file a Route Origin Authorization \(ROA\) that defines the desired address range, the autonomous system numbers \(ASNs\) allowed to advertise the address range, and an expiration date\. Upload the self\-signed certificate to your RDAP record comments\. 
+ **Amazon configuration**

  Sign a CIDR authorization context message with the private RSA key that you created, and upload the message and signature to Amazon using the AWS Command Line Interface\.

To bring on multiple address ranges, you must repeat this process with each address range\. Bringing on an address range has no effect on any address ranges that you brought on previously\.

To configure BYOIP, complete the following tasks\. For some tasks, you run Linux commands\. On Windows, you can use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) to run the Linux commands\.

**Topics**
+ [Create a key pair and certificate](#byoip-certificate)
+ [Create an ROA object in your RIR](#byoip-create-roa-object)
+ [Update the RDAP record in your RIR](#byoip-add-certificate)
+ [Provision the address range in AWS](#byoip-provision)
+ [Advertise the address range through AWS](#byoip-advertise)
+ [Deprovision the address range](#byoip-deprovision)

### Create a key pair and certificate<a name="byoip-certificate"></a>

Use the following procedure to create a self\-signed X\.509 certificate and add it to the RDAP record for your RIR\. The openssl commands require OpenSSL version 1\.0\.2 or later\.

Copy the commands below and replace only the placeholder values \(in colored italic text\)\. 

**To create a self\-signed X\.509 certificate and add it to the RDAP record**

This procedure follows the best practice of encrypting your private RSA key and requiring a pass phrase to access it\.

1. Generate an RSA 2048\-bit key pair as shown in the following\.

   ```
   $ openssl genpkey -aes256 -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 -out private-key.pem
   ```

   The `-aes256` parameter specifies the algorithm used to encrypt the private key\. The command returns the following output, including prompts to set a pass phrase:

   ```
   ......+++
   .+++
   Enter PEM pass phrase: xxxxxxx
   Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: xxxxxxx
   ```

   You can inspect the key using the following command:

   ```
   $ openssl pkey -in private-key.pem -text
   ```

   This returns a pass\-phrase prompt and the contents of the key, which shouild be similar to the following:

   ```
   Enter pass phrase for private-key.pem: xxxxxxx

   Keep your private key in a secure location when it is not in use\. 

1. Generate your public key from the private key as follows\. You will use this later to test that your signed authorization message validates correctly\.

   ```
   $ openssl rsa -in private-key.pem -pubout > public-key.pem
   ```

   On inspection, your public key should look like this:

   ```
   $ cat public-key.pem
   -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
   MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAxQVx0SOB1SgIYd7HonIq

   ywIDAQAB

   ```

1. Generate an X\.509 certificate using the key pair created in the previous\. In this example, the certificate expires in 365 days, after which time it cannot be trusted\. Be sure to set the expiration appropriately\. The `tr -d "\n"` command strips newline characters \(line breaks\) from the output\. You need to provide a Common Name when prompted, but the other fields can be left blank\.

   ```
   $ openssl req -new -x509 -key private-key.pem -days 365 | tr -d "\n" > certificate.pem
   ```

   This results in output similar to the following:

   ```
   Enter pass phrase for private-key.pem: xxxxxxx
   You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
   into your certificate request.
   What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
   There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
   For some fields there will be a default value,
   If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
   -----
   Country Name (2 letter code) []:
   State or Province Name (full name) []:
   Locality Name (eg, city) []:
   Organization Name (eg, company) []:
   Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
   Common Name (eg, fully qualified host name) []:example.com
   Email Address []:
   ```

   You can inspect the certificate with the following command:

   ```
   $ cat certificate.pem
   ```

   The output should be a long, PEM\-encoded string without line breaks, prefaced by `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and followed by `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`\.

### Create an ROA object in your RIR<a name="byoip-create-roa-object"></a>

Create an ROA object to authorize the Amazon ASNs 16509 and 14618 to advertise your address range, as well as the ASNs that are currently authorized to advertise the address range\. For the AWS GovCloud \(US\) Region, authorize ASN 8987\. You must set the maximum length to the size of the smallest prefix that you want to bring \(for example, /24\)\. It might take up to 24 hours for the ROA to become available to Amazon\. For more information, consult your RIR:
+ ARIN — [ROA Requests](https://www.arin.net/resources/rpki/roarequest.html)
+ RIPE — [Managing ROAs](https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-management/certification/resource-certification-roa-management)
+ APNIC — [Route Management](https://www.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/route-roa-management-guide.pdf)

When you migrate advertisements from an on\-premises workload to AWS, you must create an ROA for your existing ASN before creating the ROAs for Amazon's ASNs\. Otherwise, you might see an impact to your existing routing and advertisements\.

### Update the RDAP record in your RIR<a name="byoip-add-certificate"></a>

Add the certificate that you previously created to the RDAP record for your RIR\. Be sure to include the `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` strings before and after the encoded portion\. All of this content must be on a single, long line\. The procedure for updating RDAP depends on your RIR:
+ For ARIN, add the certificate in the "Public Comments" section for your address range\. Do not add it to the comments section for your organization\.
+ For RIPE, add the certificate as a new "descr" field for your address range\. Do not add it to the comments section for your organization\.
+ For APNIC, email the public key to [helpdesk@apnic\.net](mailto:helpdesk@apnic.net) to manually add it to the "remarks" field for your address range\. Send the email using the APNIC authorized contact for the IP addresses\.

### Provision the address range in AWS<a name="byoip-provision"></a>

When you provision an address range for use with AWS, you are confirming that you own the address range and are authorizing Amazon to advertise it\. We also verify that you own the address range through a signed authorization message\. This message is signed with the self\-signed X\.509 key pair that you used when updating the RDAP record with the X\.509 certificate\. AWS requires a cryptographically signed authorization message that it presents to the RIR\. The RIR authenticates the signature against the certificate that you added to RDAP, and checks the authorization details against the ROA\.

**To provision the address range**

1. 

**Compose message**

   Compose the plaintext authorization message\. The format of the message is as follows, where the date is the expiry date of the message: 

   ```
   1|aws|account|cidr|YYYYMMDD|SHA256|RSAPSS
   ```

   Replace the account number, address range, and expiry date with your own values to create a message resembling the following:

   ```
   text_message="1|aws|0123456789AB|198.51.100.0/24|20211231|SHA256|RSAPSS"
   ```

   This is not to be confused with an ROA message, which has a similar appearance\.

1. 

**Sign message**

   Sign the plaintext message using the private key that you created previously\. The signature returned by this command is a long string that you need to use in the next step\.
**Important**  
We recommend that you copy and paste this command\. Except for the message content, do not modify or replace any of the values\.

   ```
   signed_message=$( echo -n $text_message | openssl dgst -sha256 -sigopt rsa_padding_mode:pss -sigopt rsa_pss_saltlen:-1 -sign private-key.pem -keyform PEM | openssl base64 | tr -- '+=/' '-_~' | tr -d "\n")
   ```

1. 

**Provision address**

   Use the AWS CLI [provision\-byoip\-cidr](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/provision-byoip-cidr.html) command to provision the address range\. The `--cidr-authorization-context` option uses the message and signature strings that you created previously\.

   ```
   aws ec2 provision-byoip-cidr --cidr address-range --cidr-authorization-context Message="$text_message",Signature="$signed_message"
   ```

   Provisioning an address range is an asynchronous operation, so the call returns immediately, but the address range is not ready to use until its status changes from `pending-provision` to `provisioned`\.

1. 

**Monitor progress**

   It can take up to one week to complete the provisioning process for publicly advertisable ranges\. Use the [describe\-byoip\-cidrs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-byoip-cidrs.html) command to monitor progress, as in this example:

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-byoip-cidrs --max-results 5
   ```

   If there are issues during provisioning and the status goes to `failed-provision`, you must run the `provision-byoip-cidr` command again after the issues have been resolved\.

#### Provision an IPv6 address range that's not publicly advertised<a name="byoip-provision-non-public"></a>

By default, an address range is provisioned to be publicly advertised to the internet\. You can provision an IPv6 address range that will not be publicly advertised\. For routes that are not publicly advertisable, the provisioning process generally completes within minutes\. When you associate an IPv6 CIDR block from a non\-public address range with a VPC, the IPv6 CIDR can only be accessed through an AWS Direct Connect connection\. 

An ROA is not required to provision a non\-public address range\.

**Important**  
You can only specify whether an address range is publicly advertised during provisioning\. You cannot change the advertisable status later on\.

To provision an IPv6 address range that will not be publicly advertised, use the following [provision\-byoip\-cidr](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/provision-byoip-cidr.html) command\.

```
aws ec2 provision-byoip-cidr --cidr address-range --cidr-authorization-context Message="$text_message",Signature="$signed_message" --no-publicly-advertisable
```

### Advertise the address range through AWS<a name="byoip-advertise"></a>

After the address range is provisioned, it is ready to be advertised\. You must advertise the exact address range that you provisioned\. You can't advertise only a portion of the provisioned address range\.

If you provisioned an IPv6 address range that will not be publicly advertised, you do not need to complete this step\.

We recommend that you stop advertising the address range from other locations before you advertise it through AWS\. If you keep advertising your IP address range from other locations, we can't reliably support it or troubleshoot issues\. Specifically, we can't guarantee that traffic to the address range will enter our network\.

To minimize down time, you can configure your AWS resources to use an address from your address pool before it is advertised, and then simultaneously stop advertising it from the current location and start advertising it through AWS\. For more information about allocating an Elastic IP address from your address pool, see [Allocate an Elastic IP address](elastic-ip-addresses-eip.md#using-instance-addressing-eips-allocating)\.

**Limitations**
+ You can run the advertise\-byoip\-cidr command at most once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different address ranges each time\.
+ You can run the withdraw\-byoip\-cidr command at most once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different address ranges each time\.

To advertise the address range, use the following [advertise\-byoip\-cidr](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/advertise-byoip-cidr.html) command\.

```
aws ec2 advertise-byoip-cidr --cidr address-range
```

To stop advertising the address range, use the following [withdraw\-byoip\-cidr](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/withdraw-byoip-cidr.html) command\.

```
aws ec2 withdraw-byoip-cidr --cidr address-range
```

### Deprovision the address range<a name="byoip-deprovision"></a>

To stop using your address range with AWS, first release any Elastic IP addresses and disassociate any IPv6 CIDR blocks that are still allocated from the address pool\. Then stop advertising the address range, and finally, deprovision the address range\.

You cannot deprovision a portion of the address range\. If you want to use a more specific address range with AWS, deprovision the entire address range and provision a more specific address range\.

\(IPv4\) To release each Elastic IP address, use the following [release\-address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/release-address.html) command\.

```
aws ec2 release-address --allocation-id eipalloc-12345678abcabcabc
```

\(IPv6\) To disassociate an IPv6 CIDR block, use the following [disassociate\-vpc\-cidr\-block](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/disassociate-vpc-cidr-block.html) command\.

```
aws ec2 disassociate-vpc-cidr-block --association-id vpc-cidr-assoc-12345abcd1234abc1
```

To stop advertising the address range, use the following [withdraw\-byoip\-cidr](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/withdraw-byoip-cidr.html) command\.

```
aws ec2 withdraw-byoip-cidr --cidr address-range
```

To deprovision the address range, use the following [deprovision\-byoip\-cidr](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/deprovision-byoip-cidr.html) command\.

```
aws ec2 deprovision-byoip-cidr --cidr address-range
```

It can take up to a day to deprovision an address range\.

## Work with your address range<a name="byoip-working-with"></a>

You can view and use the IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges that you've provisioned in your account\.

### IPv4 address ranges<a name="byoip-work-with-ipv4"></a>

You can create an Elastic IP address from your IPv4 address pool and use it with your AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, NAT gateways, and Network Load Balancers\.

To view information about the IPv4 address pools that you've provisioned in your account, use the following [describe\-public\-ipv4\-pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-public-ipv4-pools.html) command\.

```
aws ec2 describe-public-ipv4-pools
```

To create an Elastic IP address from your IPv4 address pool, use the [allocate\-address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-address.html) command\. You can use the `--public-ipv4-pool` option to specify the ID of the address pool returned by `describe-byoip-cidrs`\. Or you can use the `--address` option to specify an address from the address range that you provisioned\.

### IPv6 address ranges<a name="byoip-work-with-ipv6"></a>

To view information about the IPv6 address pools that you've provisioned in your account, use the following [describe\-ipv6\-pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-ipv6-pools.html) command\.

```
aws ec2 describe-ipv6-pools
```

To create a VPC and specify an IPv6 CIDR from your IPv6 address pool, use the following [create\-vpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-vpc.html) command\. To let Amazon choose the IPv6 CIDR from your IPv6 address pool, omit the `--ipv6-cidr-block` option\.

```
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 --ipv6-cidr-block ipv6-cidr --ipv6-pool pool-id
```

To associate an IPv6 CIDR block from your IPv6 address pool with a VPC, use the following [associate\-vpc\-cidr\-block](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/associate-vpc-cidr-block.html) command\. To let Amazon choose the IPv6 CIDR from your IPv6 address pool, omit the `--ipv6-cidr-block` option\.

```
aws ec2 associate-vpc-cidr-block --vpc-id vpc-123456789abc123ab --ipv6-cidr-block ipv6-cidr --ipv6-pool pool-id
```

To view your VPCs and the associated IPv6 address pool information, use the [describe\-vpcs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpcs.html) command\. To view information about associated IPv6 CIDR blocks from a specific IPv6 address pool, use the following [get\-associated\-ipv6\-pool\-cidrs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-associated-ipv6-pool-cidrs.html) command\.

```
aws ec2 get-associated-ipv6-pool-cidrs --pool-id pool-id
```

If you disassociate the IPv6 CIDR block from your VPC, it's released back into your IPv6 address pool\.

For more information about working with IPv6 CIDR blocks in the VPC console, see [Working with VPCs and Subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-vpcs.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.
