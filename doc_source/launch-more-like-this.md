# Launch an instance using parameters from an existing instance<a name="launch-more-like-this"></a>

The Amazon EC2 console provides a **Launch more like this** option that enables you to use a current instance as a base for launching other instances\. This option automatically populates the Amazon EC2 launch instance wizard with certain configuration details from the selected instance\. 

**Note**  
The **Launch more like this** option does not clone your selected instance; it only replicates some configuration details\. To create a copy of your instance, first create an AMI from it, then launch more instances from the AMI\.  
Alternatively, create a [launch template](ec2-launch-templates.md) to store the launch parameters for your instances\.

The following configuration details are copied from the selected instance into the launch instance wizard:
+ AMI ID
+ Instance type
+ Availability Zone, or the VPC and subnet in which the selected instance is located
+ Public IPv4 address\. If the selected instance currently has a public IPv4 address, the new instance receives a public IPv4 address \- regardless of the selected instance's default public IPv4 address setting\. For more information about public IPv4 addresses, see [Public IPv4 addresses](using-instance-addressing.md#concepts-public-addresses)\.
+ Placement group, if applicable
+ IAM role associated with the instance, if applicable
+ Shutdown behavior setting \(stop or terminate\)
+ Termination protection setting \(true or false\)
+ CloudWatch monitoring \(enabled or disabled\)
+ Amazon EBS\-optimization setting \(true or false\)
+ Tenancy setting, if launching into a VPC \(shared or dedicated\)
+ Kernel ID and RAM disk ID, if applicable
+ User data, if specified
+ Tags associated with the instance, if applicable 
+ Security groups associated with the instance
+ Association information\. If the selected instance is associated with a configuration file, the same file is automatically associated with the new instance\. If the configuration file includes a joined domain configuration, the new instance is joined to the same domain\. For more information about joining a domain, see [Seamlessly Join a Windows EC2 Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/launching_instance.html) in the *AWS Directory Service Administration Guide*\.

The following configuration details are not copied from your selected instance\. Instead, the wizard applies their default settings or behavior:
+ Number of network interfaces: The default is one network interface, which is the primary network interface \(eth0\)\.
+ Storage: The default storage configuration is determined by the AMI and the instance type\.
