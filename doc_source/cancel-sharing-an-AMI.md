# Cancel having an AMI shared with your AWS account<a name="cancel-sharing-an-AMI"></a>

An Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) can be [shared with specific AWS accounts](sharingamis-explicit.md) by adding the accounts to the AMI's launch permissions\. If an AMI has been shared with your AWS account and you no longer want it shared with your account, you can remove your account from the AMI's launch permissions\. You do this by running the `cancel-image-launch-permission` AWS CLI command\. When running this command, your AWS account is removed from the launch permissions for the specified AMI\.

You might cancel having an AMI shared with your account, for example, to reduce the likelihood of launching an instance with an unused or deprecated AMI that was shared with you\. When you cancel having an AMI shared with your account, it no longer appears in any AMI lists in the EC2 console or in the output for [describe\-images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-images.html)\.

## Limitations<a name="cancel-sharing-an-AMI-limitations"></a>
+ You can remove your account from the launch permissions of an AMI that is shared with your AWS account only\. You can't use `cancel-image-launch-permission` to remove your account from the launch permissions of an [AMI shared with an organization or organizational unit \(OU\)](share-amis-with-organizations-and-OUs.md) or to remove access to public AMIs\.
+ You canâ€™t permanently remove your account from the launch permissions of an AMI\. An AMI owner can share an AMI with your account again\.
+ AMIs are a Regional resource\. When running `cancel-image-launch-permission`, you must specify the Region in which the AMI is located\. Either specify the Region in the command, or use the AWS\_DEFAULT\_REGION [environment variable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)\.
+ Only the AWS CLI and SDKs support removing your account from the launch permissions of an AMI\. The EC2 console does not currently support this action\.
