# On\-Demand in Spot Fleet<a name="on-demand-in-spot"></a>

To ensure that you always have instance capacity, you can include a request for On\-Demand capacity in your Spot Fleet request\. In your Spot Fleet request, you specify your desired target capacity and how much of that capacity must be On\-Demand\. The balance comprises Spot capacity, which is launched if there is available Amazon EC2 capacity and availability\. For example, if in your Spot Fleet request you specify target capacity as 10 and On\-Demand capacity as 8, Amazon EC2 launches 8 capacity units as On\-Demand, and 2 capacity units \(10\-8=2\) as Spot\.

## Prioritize instance types for On\-Demand capacity<a name="spot-fleet-on-demand-priority"></a>

When Spot Fleet attempts to fulfill your On\-Demand capacity, it defaults to launching the lowest\-priced instance type first\. If `OnDemandAllocationStrategy` is set to `prioritized`, Spot Fleet uses priority to determine which instance type to use first in fulfilling On\-Demand capacity\. The priority is assigned to the launch template override, and the highest priority is launched first\.

For example, you have configured three launch template overrides, each with a different instance type: `c3.large`, `c4.large`, and `c5.large`\. The On\-Demand price for `c5.large` is less than for `c4.large`\. `c3.large` is the cheapest\. If you do not use priority to determine the order, the fleet fulfills On\-Demand capacity by starting with `c3.large`, and then `c5.large`\. Because you often have unused Reserved Instances for `c4.large`, you can set the launch template override priority so that the order is `c4.large`, `c3.large`, and then `c5.large`\.
