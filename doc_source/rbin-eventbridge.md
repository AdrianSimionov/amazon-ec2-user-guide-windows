# Monitor Recycle Bin using Amazon EventBridge<a name="rbin-eventbridge"></a>

Recycle Bin sends events to Amazon EventBridge for actions performed on retention rules\. With EventBridge, you can establish rules that initiate programmatic actions in response to these events\. For example, you can create a EventBridge rule that sends a notification to your email when a retention rule is unlocked and it enters its unlock delay period\. For more information, see [ Creating Amazon EventBridge rules that react to events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule.html)\.

Events in EventBridge are represented as JSON objects\. The fields that are unique to the event are contained in the `detail` section of the JSON object\. The `event` field contains the event name\. The `result` field contains the completed status of the action that initiated the event\. For more information, see [Amazon EventBridge event patterns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns.html) in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*\.

For more information about Amazon EventBridge, see [What Is Amazon EventBridge?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.html) in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*\.
