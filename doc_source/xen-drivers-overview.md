# Paravirtual drivers for Windows instances<a name="xen-drivers-overview"></a>

Windows AMIs contain a set of drivers to permit access to virtualized hardware\. These drivers are used by Amazon EC2 to map instance store and Amazon EBS volumes to their devices\. The following table shows key differences between the different drivers\.


|  | RedHat PV | Citrix PV | AWS PV | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  Instance type  |  Not supported for all instance types\. If you specify an unsupported instance type, the instance is impaired\.  |  Supported for Xen instance types\.  |  Supported for Xen instance types\.  | 
|  Attached volumes  |  Supports up to 16 attached volumes\.  |  Supports more than 16 attached volumes\.  |  Supports more than 16 attached volumes\.  | 
|  Network  |  The driver has known issues where the network connection resets under high loads; for example, fast FTP file transfers\.  |    |  The driver automatically configures jumbo frames on the network adapter when on a compatible instance type\. When the instance is in a [cluster placement group](placement-groups.md), this offers better network performance between instances in the cluster placement group\.  | 

The following table shows which PV drivers you should run on each version of Windows Server on Amazon EC2\.


| Windows Server version | PV driver version | 
| --- | --- | 
| Windows Server 2022 | AWS PV latest version | 
| Windows Server 2019 | AWS PV latest version | 
| Windows Server 2016 | AWS PV latest version | 
| Windows Server 2012 R2 | AWS PV latest version | 
| Windows Server 2012  | AWS PV latest version | 
| Windows Server 2008 R2 | AWS PV version 8\.3\.5 | 
| Windows Server 2008 | Citrix PV 5\.9 | 
| Windows Server 2003 | Citrix PV 5\.9 |

## AWS PV drivers<a name="xen-driver-awspv"></a>

The AWS PV drivers are stored in the `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\Xentools` directory\. This directory also contains public symbols and a command line tool, `xenstore_client.exe`, that enables you to access entries in XenStore\. For example, the following PowerShell command returns the current time from the Hypervisor:

```
PS C:\> [DateTime]::FromFileTimeUTC((gwmi -n root\wmi -cl AWSXenStoreBase).XenTime).ToString("hh:mm:ss")
11:17:00
```

The AWS PV driver components are listed in the Windows registry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`\. These driver components are as follows: xenbus, xeniface, xennet, xenvbd, and xenvif\.

AWS PV drivers also have a Windows service named LiteAgent, which runs in user\-mode\. It handles tasks such as shutdown and restart events from AWS APIs on Xen generation instances\. You can access and manage services by running `Services.msc` from the command line\. When running on Nitro generation instances, the AWS PV drivers are not used and the LiteAgent service will self\-stop starting with driver version 8\.2\.4\. Updating to the latest AWS PV driver also updates the LiteAgent and improves reliability on all instance generations\.

### Install the latest AWS PV drivers<a name="aws-pv-download"></a>

Amazon Windows AMIs contain a set of drivers to permit access to virtualized hardware\. These drivers are used by Amazon EC2 to map instance store and Amazon EBS volumes to their devices\. We recommend that you install the latest drivers to improve stability and performance of your EC2 Windows instances\.

**Installation options**
+ You can use AWS Systems Manager to automatically update the PV drivers\. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Automatically Update PV Drivers on EC2 Windows Instances \(Console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-state-pvdriver.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*\.
+ You can [download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-windows-drivers-downloads/AWSPV/Latest/AWSPVDriver.zip) the driver package and run the install program manually\. Be sure to check the `readme.txt` file for system requirements\. For information about downloading and installing the AWS PV drivers, or upgrading a domain controller, see [Upgrade Windows Server instances \(AWS PV upgrade\)](Upgrading_PV_drivers.md#aws-pv-upgrade)\.

## Citrix PV drivers<a name="xen-driver-citrix"></a>

The Citrix PV drivers are stored in the `%ProgramFiles%\Citrix\XenTools` \(32\-bit instances\) or `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Citrix\XenTools` \(64\-bit instances\) directory\.

The Citrix PV driver components are listed in the Windows registry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services`\. These driver components are as follows: xenevtchn, xeniface, xennet, Xennet6, xensvc, xenvbd, and xenvif\.

Citrix also has a driver component named XenGuestAgent, which runs as a Windows service\. It handles tasks such as shutdown and restart events from the API\. You can access and manage services by running `Services.msc` from the command line\.

If you are encountering networking errors while performing certain workloads, you may need to disable the TCP offloading feature for the Citrix PV driver\. For more information, see [TCP offloading](pvdrivers-troubleshooting.md#citrix-tcp-offloading)\.

## RedHat PV drivers<a name="xen-driver-redhat"></a>

RedHat drivers are supported for legacy instances, but are not recommended on newer instances with more than 12GB of RAM due to driver limitations\. Instances with more than 12GB of RAM running RedHat drivers can fail to boot and become inaccessible\. We recommend upgrading RedHat drivers to Citrix PV drivers, and then upgrade Citrix PV drivers to AWS PV drivers\.

The source files for the RedHat drivers are in the `%ProgramFiles%\RedHat` \(32\-bit instances\) or `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\RedHat` \(64\-bit instances\) directory\. The two drivers are `rhelnet`, the RedHat Paravirtualized network driver, and `rhelscsi`, the RedHat SCSI miniport driver\.
