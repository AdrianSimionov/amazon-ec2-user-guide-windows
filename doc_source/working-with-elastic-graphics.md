## Configure your security groups<a name="elastic-graphics-security"></a>

Elastic Graphics requires a self\-referencing security group that allows inbound and outbound traffic to and from the security group itself\. The security group must include the following inbound and outbound rules:


|  | 
| --- |
| Inbound rule | 
| Type | Protocol | Port | Source | 
| Elastic Graphics | TCP | 2007 | The security group ID \(its own resource ID\) | 
| Outbound rule  | 
| Type | Protocol | PortÂ range | Destination | 
| Elastic Graphics | TCP | 2007 | The security group ID \(its own resource ID\) | 

If you use the Amazon EC2 console to launch your instance with an Elastic Graphics accelerator, you can either allow the launch instance wizard to automatically create the required security group rules, or you can select a security that you created previously\.

If you are launching your instance using the AWS CLI or an SDK, you must specify a security group that you created previously\.

**To create a security group for Elastic Graphics**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Security Groups** and then choose **Create security group**\.

1. In the **Create security group** window, do the following:

   1. For **Destination**, paste the security group ID that you copied previously\.

   1. Choose **Save rules**\.

For more information, see [Amazon EC2 security groups for Windows instances](ec2-security-groups.md)\.

## Launch an instance with an Elastic Graphics accelerator<a name="attach-elastic-graphics-launch"></a>

You can associate an Elastic Graphics accelerator to an instance during launch\. If the launch fails, the following are possible reasons:
+ Insufficient Elastic Graphics accelerator capacity
+ Exceeded limit on Elastic Graphics accelerators in the Region
+ Not enough private IPv4 addresses in your VPC to create a network interface for the accelerator

For more information, see [Elastic Graphics limitations](elastic-graphics.md#elastic-graphics-limitations)\.

**To associate an Elastic Graphics accelerator during instance launch \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. From the dashboard, choose **Launch Instance**\.

1. Select a Windows AMI and a supported instance type\. For more information, see [Elastic Graphics basics](elastic-graphics.md#elastic-graphics-basics)\.

1. On the **Configure Instance Details** page, select a VPC and subnet in which to launch your instance\.

1. Choose **Add Graphics Acceleration**, and select an Elastic Graphics accelerator type\.

1. \(Optional\) On the **Add Storage** and **Add Tags** pages, add volumes and tags as needed\.

1. On the **Configure Security Group** page, you can let the console create a security group for you with the required inbound and outbound rules, or you can use the security group that you created manually in [Configure your security groups](#elastic-graphics-security)\. Add additional security groups as needed\.

1. Choose **Review and Launch** to review your instance options and then choose **Launch**\.

**To associate an Elastic Graphics accelerator during instance launch \(AWS CLI\)**  
You can use the [run\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) AWS CLI command with the following parameter:

```
--elastic-gpu-specification Type=eg1.medium
```

For the `--security-group-ids` parameter, you must include a security group that has the required inbound and outbound rules\. For more information, see [Configure your security groups](#elastic-graphics-security)\.

**To associate an Elastic Graphics accelerator during instance launch \(Tools for Windows PowerShell\)**  
Use the [New\-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Instance.html) Tools for Windows PowerShell command\.

## Install the required software for Elastic Graphics<a name="elastic-graphics-install-libraries"></a>

If you launched your instance using a current AWS Windows AMI, the required software is installed automatically during the first boot\. If you launched your instance using Windows AMIs that do not automatically install the required software, you must install the required software on the instance manually\.

**To install the required software for Elastic Graphics \(if necessary\)**

1. Connect to the instance\.

1. Download the [Elastic Graphics installer](http://ec2-elasticgpus.s3-website.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest) and open it\. The installation manager connects to the Elastic Graphics endpoint and downloads the latest version of the required software\.
**Note**  
If the download link does not work, try a different browser, or copy the link address and paste it into a new browser tab\.

1. Reboot the instance to verify\.

## Verify Elastic Graphics functionality on your instance<a name="elastic-graphics-verify-instance"></a>



The Elastic Graphics packages on your instance include tools that you can use to view the status of the accelerator, and to verify that OpenGL commands from your instance to the accelerator are functional\.

If your instance was launched with an AMI that does not have the Elastic Graphics packages pre\-installed, you can download and install them yourself\. For more information, see [Install the required software for Elastic Graphics](#elastic-graphics-install-libraries)\.

You can use one of the following methods to verify Elastic Graphics functionality on your instance\.

**Note**
